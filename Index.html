                <p class="arthur-subtitle">We’re living in somewhat of a CSS renaissance with new features, techniques, experiments, and ideas
                    coming at us to an extent we haven’t seen since “CSS3”. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed when your
                    profession seems to be advancing at breakneck speed, but Geoff Graham considers the ways “modern”
                    CSS in 2023 has actually made CSS “easier” to write.
